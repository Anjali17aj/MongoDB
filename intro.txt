Mongo shell is a platform where we can run Mongo DB commands, add data, update data, delete data.
In this repo I have used mongo Shell to perform CRUD operations.
Mongo is also a type of JavaScript shell.
C : Create/insert
R : Read/Find 
U : update
D : delete
Whenever we open a mongo shell it temporarily makes a database for us named "Test" but its not permanently stored in memory.
